# Github Finder

This project involves working with the Github API, a global context and the use of advanced hooks like useReducer. For styling Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI were used. The spinner was taken from <a href="https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/">David Hu's</a> amazing react spinner package.

The application is part of the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/">"React Front To Back 2022"</a> by Brad Travery.

Further functionality will be added as the course progresses.
